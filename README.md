Do your editing as an adult with this super boring "colorscheme" that only uses colors for comments and ui elements.

All colors used are taken from the [IBM Carbon Design System](https://carbondesignsystem.com/elements/color/overview/) and have a contrast compliant with WCAG Level AA (at the least).
